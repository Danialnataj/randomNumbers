# Random Numbers

My second project in introductory to Java course.
This projects lets the user pick a certain amount of random numbers ranging between 0-999.
The program will then present to the user how many of these numbers are odd and how many even.
E.g. If user says 30 the program will generate 30 random numbers and then present that 12 are odd numbers and 18 are even.
The program will also group the numbers in their respective odd or even category.
